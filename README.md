This C++ program reads sensor data from a CSV file, simulates a robot's movement and 
sensor readings, and then creates an occupancy grid based on the data. The occupancy 
grid is a 2D representation of the environment where the robot moves, with '#' representing 
obstacles and '.' representing empty spaces. The program uses the FreeImage library to 
save the generated grid as a bitmap image.
